The Wheal Betsy engine house is located just off the A386 Okehampton to Tavistock road. It is easily missed from the road, which rises causeway-like from the surrounding moors.Â  Whilst the remains of these tin mine workings seem striking, but not uncommon for the area, a closer look will reveal the unusual curvature of the chimney, clearly visible in these images.
