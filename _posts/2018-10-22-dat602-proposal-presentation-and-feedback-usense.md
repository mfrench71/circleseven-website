**Presentation Guidelines**

Each group will have 20 minutes to present their proposal (10 minutes of presentation, and 10 minutes of Q&amp;A). For each presentation, it is recommended that you use a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 10 slides.

It is highly recommended to do as much preparation for the development of this proposal as possible, so that you will receive useful feedback. Laying the foundations of your project at this stage is quite critical for its later development.

A structure that you should be using is the following:
<ol>
 	- Introduction (provide a brief explanation about your project and why you believe it is important or interesting)
 	- Context (here you may include inspiring works, research projects, or literature review – demonstrate the context that the work is based on)
 	- Methodology (how you are considering to develop this project – milestones, technologies involved, problems that you need to solve)
 	- Intended Outcomes (show how the final project might look/function like)
 	- Conclusion (summarise and conclude)
</ol>
The proposal presentations were scheduled for Thursday 18 October. From 11 October - 17 October, I developed the content for the introduction (including the product mock-up artwork), context, methodology, functionality, and referencing.

I conducted some research into the current incidence of anxiety and mental health issues, as well as products that might meet a similar need to our proposed project.

My notes the Facebook group:

"Hi guys .... I have made a start on the presentation for tomorrow. It would be great if you could take a look and add anything to the slides. Visuals are just 'artist's impressions' We'll need to meet up before the session tomorrow to go through who is presenting which bits."

"And I just came up with the name off the top of my head ... it doesn't have to be final."

Sam contributed a slide on the psychology of images, and Lee contributed a slide on the psychology of colour.

On the day of the presentation, we met to finalise the content of the presentation and who would be presenting which slides.

The final presentation can be seen here:

<h2>Feedback</h2>
We received some valuable and insightful feedback from the 3D Design student cohort and tutors in attendance. This can be summarised as follows:
 	- Move away from a tablet design. The general feeling was that a tablet design was not ideal and also difficult to implement. Perhaps a photo-frame or a design that was more in keeping with domestic context (such as a tactile ornament) would be more suitable.
 	- Face detection might be used to establish whether the user is in front of the device and the device could use its integrated screen to display appropriate images. If the user is not present, the image could be projected from the device, so the user can see it wherever they are. Ultimately, we thought that projecting the image would be a better solution, regardless of whether the user was sitting at the device.
 	- The project does not have to be commercially viable.
 	- "Your presentation was good in overall, however, you need to simplify, be more precise, and demonstrate more depth of research (and knowledge). Many of your claims are too vague and unsupported, and you didn’t demonstrate sufficient sources of inspiration."
