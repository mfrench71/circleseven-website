<h3>The Brief: Time Bank Web Application</h3>
Your team has been contracted to produce an interactive PHP web application, for a newly set up <em>Time Bank</em>.

Key timebanking principles are:
<ul>
 	<li>People list the skills and experience which they can offer and those that they may need.</li>
 	<li>Everyoneâ€™s skills are valued equally - one hour always equals one time credit.</li>
 	<li>Everyone agrees to both give and to receive help, to earn and to spend their time credits.</li>
 	<li>A record is kept of all the time credits earned and spent.</li>
 	<li>Everyone is encouraged to spend their time credits to allow others the chance to make a difference and feel needed.</li>
</ul>
The main functions of the completed web application are:
<ul>
 	<li>User sign-up system with username, email address and password strength checking</li>
 	<li>User login/logout system</li>
 	<li>Home page with user profile and matched skills</li>
 	<li>Two-step approval system for skill offers/acceptance</li>
 	<li>Time credit transfers</li>
 	<li>Edit profile (skills)</li>
 	<li>Site statistics</li>
</ul>
