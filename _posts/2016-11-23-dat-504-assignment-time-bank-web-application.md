<h3>The Brief: Time Bank Web Application</h3>
Your team has been contracted to produce an interactive PHP web application, for a newly set up *Time Bank*.

Key timebanking principles are:
 	- People list the skills and experience which they can offer and those that they may need.
 	- Everyoneâ€™s skills are valued equally - one hour always equals one time credit.
 	- Everyone agrees to both give and to receive help, to earn and to spend their time credits.
 	- A record is kept of all the time credits earned and spent.
 	- Everyone is encouraged to spend their time credits to allow others the chance to make a difference and feel needed.

The main functions of the completed web application are:
 	- User sign-up system with username, email address and password strength checking
 	- User login/logout system
 	- Home page with user profile and matched skills
 	- Two-step approval system for skill offers/acceptance
 	- Time credit transfers
 	- Edit profile (skills)
 	- Site statistics
