Brief: In the next practical you must create a graphical visualisation of a textual data file (to be given out in the practical). Read in the data and use it to generate some kind of visual output.

Rather than using Pygame to create your visualisation (which is powerful, but can be tricky to install), we will be using a library called graphics.py. This can just be dropped into your folder and used (no install needed).

<p>The data we were provided with were a list of our results from the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dat-505-assignment-part-1-mobile-app-development/">previous DAT 505 assignment</a>:</p>

52, 47, 57, 49, 59, 62, 44, 76, 52, 52, 44, 59, 59, 79, 59, 42, 57, 48, 80, 43, 72, 74, 59, 44, 57, 55, 49, 54, 54

Here is the result of my Python graphics programming:
