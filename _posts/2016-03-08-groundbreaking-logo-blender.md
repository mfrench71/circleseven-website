<p>Some time ago, I was just starting out with&nbsp;Maxon's Cinema 4D application and followed along with <a href="http://cgi.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-powerful-groundbreaking-logo-reveal-cg-part--cg-27011">this tutorial</a>, both as a learning exercise and because I liked the end result.</p>

<p>Now having had a taste of <a href="http://www.blender.org">Blender</a> as part of my <a href="http://www.circleseven.co.uk/2016/02/27/dat-406-assignment-part-2-multiverse/">DAT406 university assignment</a>, I was keen to repeat the learning process and so decided to use the same tutorial. This time I would apply the techniques, albeit it in a slightly less polished and refined form than in Joe's tutorial, to Blender. This is the result...</p>
