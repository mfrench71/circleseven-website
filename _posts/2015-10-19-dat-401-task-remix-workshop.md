**Mashups and remixes** are a form of collage; placing found elements next to each other to create something new. They might be music mashups which (more or less) skilfully combine different songs into a new whole, comedy mashups of different videos or adbusts in which an advert is subverted by overlaying it with a new soundtrack.

**Workshop Activity**

During the mashup workshop and using Youtube's video editor functionality, I experimented with&nbsp;video material of special forces personnel taking part in a training exercise using an assault course. This was overplayed with audio of the *Everything is Awesome* song from *The Lego Movie* soundtrack.

The visuals&nbsp;of masculine activity overlaid&nbsp;with the feel-good, happy melody of the audio created an interesting juxtaposition. The gung-ho attitude of the military personnel was undermined nicely by the upbeat and cheerful audio, whilst at the same time linking the co-operation required to complete the assault course with the 'everything is cool when you're part of a team' lyric.

<p>My second effort utilised the Youtube Doubler website (<a href="http://youtubedoubler.com/">http://youtubedoubler.com/</a>) to mashup footage from Monty Python's *Monty Python &amp; The Holy Grail* movie with the audio from the Ridley Scott film *Gladiator*. Python's hilarious visuals of the fight scene between Arthur and&nbsp;the Black Knight were accompanied by the much more serious and sombre audio from the scene where Gladiator reveals himself to the Roman emperor.</p>

Both these examples interest me as they each use humour to alter the perception of the material presented to the viewer.
