My final year project will involve the use of photogrammetry to create a 3D model of an existing item of cultural heritage significance, for instance: the remains of a building, building interior, or individual objects.

Having carried out some research on the various photogrammetry software packages available, I decided to use <a href="https://www.capturingreality.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RealityCapture</a>. This seemed to combine speed of processing with an intuitive workflow.

Below is the, admittedly somewhat rough, result of my first proper test, carried out in my back garden.

I took 72 photographs in RAW mode using my Nikon D3200 DSLR. RealityCapture processed the images, creating a 3D model in approximately 30 minutes.

Photographs were taken from ground level, hence the missing shed roof (the camera didn't see it). Also, reflective surfaces (such as windows) are difficult for the software to process, so these appear distorted. However, this shouldn't be a problem as the sites I have investigated have no windows!

It was interesting to partially capture the interior of the the shed (through the green door), and it seemed to pay to capture more images as I traversed around the corners of the house and shed.
