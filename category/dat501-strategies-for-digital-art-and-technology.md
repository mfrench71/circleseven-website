description: "This module covers the historical and contemporary context of digital art, design and production, and the principles of design and media theories. We look at the impact of 20th century art and design practices and paradigms on a current digital media production, and the critical and theoretical skills necessary for the design and production of digital media, combined with audio-visual research techniques and project management. The module looks at research and critical evaluation skills necessary for developing academic writing incorporating a wide range of relevant critical theories, debates and intellectual paradigms. We look at a variety of subjects that inform digital art practice and screenings of relevant films. Finally you will learn about the Final Stage Award Theme choice, write a paper and create an artwork for public exhibition. The module is assessed by the written paper and exhibition piece."
