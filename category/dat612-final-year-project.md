description: "This is where everything you have learned over the last 2 or 3 years comes together to make the best piece of work you possibly can! What you are asked to do is present us with a substantial interactive project. It can take any form you like, for example; a web application, an internet of things project, an interactive art installation, an app, a performance using digital technology, a game. And there are many others.

By now you should have a good idea of the kinds of work you like to do and media you like to use. In collaboration with your supervisor, you’ll design, develop and create to a high standard a project in that area. Aim for something you’d be proud to put on your showreel and show to the public in the final year exhibition, and don’t forget, skills such as creativity, project planning, problem solving and effective research are just as important in producing a high-quality result as coding and soldering.

The module builds up to the end of your degree and the Final Year Degree Show Exhibition and this is where you will exhibit your Final Year Projects collectively. This is an exciting end to the last 2 or 3 years of work and is a celebration of the work you have achieved which attracts a large crowd including friends, family, academics and industry experts."
